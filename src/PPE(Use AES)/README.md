PPE is a cross-platform encryption library that leverages parallel processing to provide high-performance encryption and decryption capabilities. It's available for Python, MicroPython, C++, and Java, making it versatile for various applications from embedded systems to high-performance servers.

## Features

- **Multi-platform Support**: Run on any platform that supports Python, MicroPython, C++, or Java
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilize multiple cores for faster encryption/decryption operations
- **Multiple Encryption Algorithms**:
  - AES (128/256-bit)
  - ChaCha20
  - Blowfish
  - Custom hybrid encryption modes
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized for both resource-constrained and high-performance systems
- **Thread Safety**: Safe for concurrent operations
- **Streaming Support**: Process large files without loading them entirely into memory

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rezafarazi/PPE.git
```

## Usage

### Python
```python
# main run
if __name__ == '__main__':

    data = "salam"

    encrypted_data = PPE(data, "reza")
    print(f"Encrypted: {encrypted_data}")
    
    decrypted_data = PPD(encrypted_data, "reza")
    print(f"Decrypted: {decrypted_data}")

```

### MicroPython
```python
# main run
enc1 = PPE("salam", "reza")
dec1 = PPD(enc1, "reza")

print("Text encript is : ", enc1)
print("Text decript is : ", dec1)
```

### Java
```java
package com.rezafta;

import com.rezafta.PPE.PPE;
import com.rezafta.PPE.Types.EncriptionTypes;

/**
 * Hello world!
 *
 */
public class App 
{
    public static void main( String[] args ) throws Exception
    {

        PPE p=new PPE();
        String result=p.GetEncription("salam", "reza",EncriptionTypes.AES);
        System.out.println("En last is : "+result);

        String results=p.GetDecription(result,"reza",EncriptionTypes.AES);
        System.out.println("De last is : "+results);

    }

}
```
